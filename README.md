This repository contains Hackolade data models that can be viewed on https://hub.hackolade.com

The Hackolade Enterprise Model Hub is a metadata collaboration platform providing a unified and central access to your Hackolade Studio data models stored in one or more Git repositories.  It empowers business teams, governance teams, and other stakeholders to collaborate effectively in order to promote a shared understanding of the context and meaning of data.

Feel free to explore at your leisure.  It even allows you to load your own models to the repository, and view them in the Hub.  We advise each organization to create its own folder, separate from others.  The models and model changes you would push to the repository are auto-merged, then automatically replicated to the Hub database.  They should appear in a few seconds.

An online user documentation can be found [here](https://hackolade.com/help/Hubuserinterface.html). 

**WARNING:** the Hackolade Model Hub is totally open to anyone, so we strongly suggest to refrain from loading any confidential models.  We reserve the right to remove any inappropriate content from the repository.
